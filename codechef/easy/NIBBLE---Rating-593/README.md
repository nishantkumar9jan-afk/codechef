## Problem

### Good Program

In computing, the collection of  **four bits**  is called a  **nibble**.

Chef defines a program as:

- Good, if it takes exactly $X$ nibbles of memory, where $X$ is a positive integer.
- Not Good, otherwise.

Given a program which takes $N$  **bits**  of memory, determine whether it is  **Good**  or  **Not Good**.

### Input Format
- First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$, the number of bits taken by the program.
### Output Format

For each test case, output $\texttt{Good}$ or $\texttt{Not Good}$ in a single line. You may print each character of $\texttt{Good}$ or $\texttt{Not Good}$ in uppercase or lowercase (for example, $\texttt{GoOd}$, $\texttt{GOOD}$, $\texttt{good}$ will be considered identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$
### Subtasks

 **Subtask #1 (100 points):**  original constraints

Output

```
4
8
17
52
3
```

```
Good
Not Good
Good
Not Good
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case 1:**  The program requires $8$ bits of memory. This is equivalent to $\frac{8}{4} = 2$ nibbles. Since $2$ is an integer, this program is good.

 **Test case 2:**  The program requires $17$ bits of memory. This is equivalent to $\frac{17}{4} = 4.25$ nibbles. Since $4.25$ is not an integer, this program is not good.

 **Test case 3:**  The program requires $52$ bits of memory. This is equivalent to $\frac{52}{4} = 13$ nibbles. Since $13$ is an integer, this program is good.

 **Test case 4:**  The program requires $3$ bits of memory. This is equivalent to $\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$ nibbles. Since $0.75$ is not an integer, this program is not good.

## Solution

**Language:** c_cpp  
**Runtime:** N/A  
**Memory:** N/A

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
int t;
cin>>t;
while(t--){
    int x;
    cin>>x;
    if(x%4==0){
        cout<<"good"<<endl;
    } else
        cout<<"Not good"<<endl;
}
}

```
