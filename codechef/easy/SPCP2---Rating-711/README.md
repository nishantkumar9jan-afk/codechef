## Problem

### Minimum number of coins

Chef has infinite coins in denominations of rupees $5$ and rupees $10$.

Find the  **minimum**  number of coins Chef needs, to pay  **exactly**  $X$ rupees. If it is impossible to pay $X$ rupees in denominations of rupees $5$ and $10$ only, print $-1$.

### Input Format
- First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case contains of a single integer $X$.
### Output Format

For each test case, print a single integer - the  **minimum**  number of coins Chef needs, to pay  **exactly**  $X$ rupees. If it is impossible to pay $X$ rupees in denominations of rupees $5$ and $10$ only, print $-1$.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq X \leq 1000$
### Subtasks
- Subtask 1 (100 points): Original constraints.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
50
15
8

```

```
5
2
-1

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case $1$:**  Chef would require at least $5$ coins to pay $50$ rupees. All these coins would be of rupees $10$.

 **Test Case $2$:**  Chef would require at least $2$ coins to pay $15$ rupees. Out of these, $1$ coin would be of rupees $10$ and $1$ coin would be of rupees $5$.

 **Test Case $3$:**  Chef cannot pay exactly $8$ rupees in denominations of rupees $5$ and $10$ only.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    
    // If x is not divisible by 5, it's impossible to form the amount
    if (x % 5 != 0) {
        cout << -1 << "\n";
    } else {
        // If x is divisible by 5, we maximize 10-rupee coins to minimize total coins
        cout << (x + 5) / 10 << "\n";
    }
}

int main() {
    // Fast I/O
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
