## Problem

### Count the Notebooks

You know that $1$ kg of pulp can be used to make $1000$ pages and $1$ notebook consists of $100$ pages.

Suppose a notebook factory receives $N$ kg of pulp, how many notebooks can be made from that?

### Input Format
- First line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case contains a single integer $N$ - the weight of the pulp the factory has (in kgs).
### Output Format

For each test case, output the number of notebooks that can be made using $N$ kgs of pulp.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
1
100
50

```

```
10
1000
500

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case-1:**  $1$ kg of pulp can be used to make $1000$ pages which can be used to make $10$ notebooks.

 **Test case-2:**  $100$ kg of pulp can be used to make $100000$ pages which can be used to make $1000$ notebooks.

 **Test case-3:**  $50$ kg of pulp can be used to make $50000$ pages which can be used to make $500$ notebooks.

using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
int t;
cin>>t;
while(t--){
    int x;
    cin>>x;
    cout<<x*10<<endl;
}
}
