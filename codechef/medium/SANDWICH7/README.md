```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Fast I/O
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int B, H, C;
    if (cin >> B >> H >> C) {
        // Calculate the limiting factor between bread pairs and total fillings
        int max_sandwiches = min(B / 2, H + C);
        cout << max_sandwiches << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```
